## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**
### 2.1: Dataset:

[Covid 19](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data)
This dataset contains detailed information about each person affected by the coronavirus. 

[Covid 19: mitigation measures](http://epidemicforecasting.org/containment)
This dataset contains government measures to slow down the propagation of the coronavirus.

The further datasets represent people affected by the Ebola and SARS disease. The following datasets
would be interesting for comparing the number of case/death between the corona virus and the Ebola/SARS. 
[SARS](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/sars-outbreak-2003-complete-dataset),
[Ebola](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/ebola-outbreak-20142016-complete-dataset) 

As a first look the datasets seems to be really good and do not need a big preprocessing work.

### 2.2: Problematic:

* What am I trying to show with my visualization? 

  Our visualization will try to show as best as we can who and where people are affected by the corona virus and also how fast the virus spreads. Our visualization will thus show the violence of the virus.

* Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

  Since the corona virus is happening right now and impact our living, the whole population wants to be informed of the coronavirus. We would split our project into three parts:
  - An overview of the dataset to show which type of people is mainly affected (age, sex), how dangerous it is (mortality rate, hospital rate) and the comparison with the Ebola/ SARS disease.
  - Where and how fast the virus spreads among the world (A map showing the number of cases/deaths over time)
  - How the government decisions impact the spread of the virus.

### 2.4: Related work:

* What others have already done with the data?

Multiple maps updated regularly with the new information incoming every time. The most famous one is the Johns Hopkins map which shows the global situation in the world but also specific statistics for each country.

* Why is your approach original?

Our approach is original as we will try to get an insight of the repercutions of politic countermeasures on the general spread of the virus and also compare the efficacity of different politics on the evolution of the pandemic.

* What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).

Considering the extroardinary turn of events as the lockdown of the most part of the world and the trumendous economic crisis that we face, we wanted to elaborate conclusions and better understand the politic decisions by working at the data from scratch.
